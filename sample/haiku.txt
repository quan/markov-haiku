change in pitch
as the nail enters wood—
an ache beyond reach

over the crib
a universe
in suspense

off to on I disappear into the visible

third deployment
the unfinished dollhouse
beneath a sheet

heat lightning
the sound of white corn
being shucked

onion skin
I open myself
to the rain

braiding my daughter's hair
just enough tension

blister moon
a wish
rubbed raw

afternoon rain
emptying a book
of its words

still watching me
with her knowing look—
my childhood doll

air show . . .
the ice cream girls
compare nail polish

her letter . . .
I'd forgotten
paper can cut

silence of snow 
we listen to the house
   grow smaller

porch swing    my feelings    come and go

new love the up and down of her teabag

dawn swim—
making a butterfly of water
of light

summer heat
the strands of hair not captured
by her braid

mating dragonflies—
my overuse 
of dashes

after she leaves 
the weight 
of hanging apples

how some things end—
onion flakes
    in the market sack

whale songs . . .
when did we stop
talking

most of
what is 
right
in
a wild 
flower
patch

woodsmoke . . .
the guilt of living
on

lapping shore water— 
the things we take 
for granted

first frost
the echo in the caw
of the crow

autumn riff
aspen leaves a few notes higher
than the stream

bare maple
my daughter says
she'll come back

reddening apples—
my newborn tries to suckle
the orchard air

the glare off snow
has the run of the house
February's extra day

empty house—
a whisper of mother's voice
in the autumn wind

rain settles
some of the pollen 
some of the plans

distant singing—
the winter stars
almost touch

after sunset . . .
the shapes 
of the clouds

circle of pines
God absent
from the wedding vows

open scissors beside a vase of water

spring rain—
milk in her left breast
unexpectedly sweeter

spring evening
the children's promise
not to get cold

autumn morning—
repainting our bedroom 
the color it was

jackknifed rig
the trooper waves us
into wildflowers

the numbness
of scar tissue—
forsythia

autumn wind
in his sweater pocket
the missing button

squash vines
long and hollow
the last late evenings

dim light
the night nurse
describes the rain

late summer
black men spreading tar
on the side road

knowing your cough
but not your face—
invalid neighbor

spring plowing
a flock of blackbirds
turns inside out

squash vines
long and hollow
the last late evenings

dusk—
up to my ears
in birdsong

all around
light falling in a field
of fireflies

Independence Day—
I let him touch
a little bit of me

snake hunting the boy sheds his shirt

whistling
he
hangs
the
birdhouse
he
built

summer evening
fanning myself
with a paper moon

close lightning
   the metallic taste
            in my mouth

garden work—
talking to each other
back to back

dry heat—
to the same withered flower
a bee returns

starry night—
biting into a melon
full of seeds

I brush
my mother's hair
the sparks

snowflakes glued
to the kindergarten window—
no two alike

undefended:
   in the cold rain
   their snow fort

faint city stars ...
the moth's copper dust
in my palm

Father's funeral
              Mother
              suddenly small

porch swing
   now and then     a breeze
      from the river

January thaw
the narrow path
fading away

spring planting
her refusal
to compromise

Logging road—
          the pileated woodpecker
                    flings its cry ahead

ill again
a dry leaf
across porch boards

leaving the park—
glimpses of cherry petals
on the soles of shoes

Lily pond
   with one step the snowy egret
  moves the moon

the white v of a killdeer's wings
  opening in the wake
of its cry

snow
softening
     the night

a pile of rocks
shifting in spring rain
the stiff old man

getting louder
the calf
the auctioneer

bird shadow
from tree shadow
to fence shadow

i climb the mountain with my eyes never ending snow

the petals scatter
over graves swept
and unswept

a single leaf falling
   and with it
      the morning dew

mountain rose—
from thorn to thorn
a spider's line

coming out of the woods—
the sound of crickets,
the empty sky

An old woman with bread
waves the geese down
from the sky.

Into old pots and pans
thrown out in the backyard—
the musical rain

    in a backyard
two women folding sunlight
    into sheets

falling leaves
day by day
the house grows brighter

         darkening path
the white morning glories
         lead the way

Up in the sky
hardly heard, hardly seen:
migrating birds

First spring day
melting and melting and melting
tracks of the mountain man.

night storm —
a deeper dark unrolls
across the prairie

     anzio beach ...
           another wave gathers
and breaks

soothing rain:
the mown meadow releases
pungence of mint

Butterfly shadows ...
     not finding
          the butterfly

longest night—
his forehead burning
into my hand

gone from the wood
      the bird I knew
           by song alone

on Lookout Rock
one step
to the red hawk

cajun cabin ...
the aroma of hot gumbo
floats on the bayou

over the earth's edge
they all go—the white clouds
and the one sailboat

on the cardboard box
    holding the frozen wino:
        Fragile: Do Not Crush

Last night's fading dream ...
On the blue teapot birds drift
beyond the willows

a swallowtail
                 settles
on the prize-winning quilt

snow geese
Sarah discovers
the letter V

still in the taste
of afternoon tea,
my grandmother's brogue

a horse-drawn plow:
sunflowers stand
in the traces

Eaves
           pulling sound
                                   from the wind

     walking alone
the way oak leaves
     refuse to fall

a steady rain
the dentist's drill
turning to snow

top of the falls
     your voice somewhere
in its sound

The worm
far out on this paved lot
more rain

autumn dusk the crooked road home

winter morning—
the closet dark with
old shoes

The family gathered—
a tear of embalming fluid runs
from my brother's eye

a moth flies
through my breath
in moonlight

bitter wind ...
the hand that cups the flame
aglow

The sound of scissors
through quilt stuffing:
     chill autumn moon

autumn maple
a gust of yellow scatters
the child's laughter

autumn sky
the wind folds and unfolds
a flock of sparrows

moving into the sun
the pony takes with him
some mountain shadow


  paddling slowly
 through the reeds
that touch her hair

    the old woman
looking into the stars
     sky all snowy

Against his coat
I brush my lips—
the silence of snowflakes

away from eyes
the stairwell holds
us in its arms

that sonofabitch
on the corner has a knife—
the rain glistens on it

still
childless:
milkweed

Winter's end
   a bitterness remaining
        in the dried apricots

the old garden fence
now keeps the goldenrod
from the goldenrod

Thin icicles
on the telephone wire
her distant voice

hoping the shape
of the navel will be good
father cuts the cord

one cricket       sound and silence lighting the autumn garden

hot rock by the stream
each of the baby's toeprints
evaporating

switching off the light
switching off the shadows
